# open_set_deep_net
Implementation of **"Towards Open Set Deep Networks"** using **Python** and **Tensorflow** using **VGG-13 net** and **STL- 10** Dataset with **libMR** library

Implemented using Jupyter Notebook

# Instructions:

Run each cell one by one.

*The code has been written for STL-10 dataset. If other datasets are used then, the user may be need to tune the network hyperparameters and also the threshold used in the Meta-recognition algorithm*

*STL-10 Dataset was used because it is small, and is easier to train in less computationa time and with less computation power. Furthermore it also contains 100000 unlabeled images.*

*However, miniImagenet can also be used*

**Tailsize** used: **50**

**Threshold** used: **0.5**

**Number of Channels** : **1**

**Alpha** value used: **10**
