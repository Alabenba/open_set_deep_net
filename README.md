# open_set_deep_net
Implementation of **"Towards Open Set Deep Networks"** using **Python** and **Tensorflow** using **VGG net** and **STL- 10** Dataset without **libMR** library

Implemented using Jupyter Notebook

# Instructions:

Run each cell one by one.

*The code has been written for STL-10 dataset. If other datasets are used then, the user may be need to tune the network hyperparameters.*

*STL-10 Dataset was used because it is small, and is easier to train in less computationa time and with less computation power. Furthermore it also contains 100000 unlabeled images.*
